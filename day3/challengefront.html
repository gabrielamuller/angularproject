        </p>
        <p>Limited production of the Model 3 began in July 2017, with the first production vehicle rolling off the assembly line on July 7, 2017 and the official launch and delivery of the first 30 cars on July 28. Tesla CEO Elon Musk expects production to reach 20,000 vehicles per month by December 2017 or approximately 50 percent of the design capacity of the manufacturing line.</p>
		<p>Within a week of the 2016 unveiling, Tesla said they had taken 325,000 Model 3 reservations, more than triple the number of Model S sedans Tesla had sold by the end of 2015.
